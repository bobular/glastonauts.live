      <h2>Audio and listening help</h2>

      <p>
	At least one of the <i class="fa fa-play-circle-o
				      fa-inverse"></i>
	links on the right should get some music
	playing in your phone or computer's browser.
      </p>

      <p>
	If that doesn't work or if you would like more control and to
	see the track names (when available), try playing the audio
	stream in your faviourite audio player app.  Most have a
	"connect to internet broadcast/stream" option. If you don't
	have an audio player, you can
	try <a href="https://www.videolan.org">VLC</a> from the
	'VideoLAN' project. You can get the app on Android and iPhone
	too (make sure it's from VideoLAN).  It may not be the
	smoothest and coolest player around, but it is totally and
	completely free. No ads, no trial periods, no nothing.
      </p>

      <p>
	To play the stream in your audio player app, you'll need to
	copy-paste the stream URL into the player by clicking on the
	<i class="fa fa-copy"></i> icon next to the stream link and
	then on the button that appears.  In VLC on iOS,
	it's <i>Network->Open Network Stream</i>. In VLC on Android go
	to
	<i>Stream</i> in the main menu.
      </p>

      <p>
	Also, very important... connect your device to some decent speakers
	and enjoy!
