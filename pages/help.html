			<h2>Audio and listening help</h2>

			<p>
				The web-player on the homepage, or
				the 'm3u' or 'Direct' links above
				should get some music playing in your
				phone or computer's browser.</p>

			<p>
				If that doesn't work or if you would like more control and to
				see the track names (when available), try playing the audio
				stream in your faviourite audio player app. Most have a
				"connect to internet broadcast/stream" option. If you don't
				have an audio player, you can
				try <a class="altlink" href="https://www.videolan.org">VLC</a> from the
				'VideoLAN' project. You can get the app on Android and iPhone
				too (make sure it's from VideoLAN). It may not be the
				smoothest and coolest player around, but it is totally and
				completely free. No ads, no trial periods, no nothing.
			</p>

			<p>
				To play the stream in your audio
				player app, you'll need to copy-paste
				the stream URL into the player by
				right-clicking or long-pressing on
				either the 'm3u' or 'Direct' links
			  above to copy the link location.
			  In VLC on iOS, it's <i>Network->Open Network Stream</i>. In VLC on Android go
				to
				<i>Stream</i> in the main menu.
			</p>

			<p>
				Also, very important... connect your device to some decent speakers
				and enjoy!

		  <p>Birthday bash links for DJs...</p>

		  <p>Please click on the link (DJ1 or DJ2) that you've been asked to click on..
		    <br/>
		    It will work best in Chrome, Edge or Firefox, and with as few as possible tabs and other apps open.
		    <br/>
		    Please close the browser tab when you've finished playing; the next DJ needs to use it to sound check.

		      ((Please also close the control room browser tab when not using it, as it sucks bandwidth from Giannis.))</li>
