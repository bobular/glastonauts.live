      <h2>How it all began</h2>
      <p>
	On 21 March 2020 as the UK was starting to lock down in
	response to the pandemic, a bunch of Glastonbury
	Festival-goers on a WhatsApp group streamed a couple of live
	DJ sets over the internet to each other. A few days later we
	had a domain name, a basic website and a dedicated radio
	chat. We started streaming playlists too, some
	of them live collaborative ones. The music policy was simple:
	there was no policy. Anyone who wanted to contribute was
	welcome to. In the beginning we filled each others homes with
	music and banter seven days a week.
      </p>

      <h2>How it developed</h2>
      <p>
	As time went by and the lockdowns came and went, we settled
	down into a more weekend-focused schedule. We branched out
	into quizzes, comedy hour, community hour talk radio, serious
	listening and more. We kept pumping out playlists and DJ sets
	- over 300 in total (end of 2020). We're especially proud to have nurtured
	new DJ talent, and are hugely grateful to our "old" DJ friends
	for delivering flawless and innovative sets time after time.
	Check them out if you haven't already - virtually all of our
	DJ sets are available on <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Glastonauts_Live/">Mixcloud</a>,
	while our playlist links can be found in the <a href="archive.html">archive</a>.
	We're also very proud to have at least three talented producers in our collective: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mrlostlegend">LostLegend</a>, <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Glastonauts_Live/droppenkiken-aka-dj-sebster-unreleased/">Droppenkiken aka DJ Sebster</a>, and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/sirstylesmusic">Sir Styles</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Where we are going</h2>
      <p>
	For "reasons", we need to keep the community small and personal,
	so the radio chat and playlist submission remain
	invite-only. However, everyone is welcome to join the <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Glastonauts_Live/">Mixcloud</a> community,
	so give us a follow on there, and keep an eye on the <a href="./">schedule</a> if
	you want to catch a set live before it hits the cloud.
