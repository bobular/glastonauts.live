			<h2>How it all began</h2>
			<p>
				On 21 March 2020 as the UK was starting to lock down in
				response to the pandemic, a bunch of Glastonbury
				Festival-goers on a WhatsApp group streamed a couple of live
				DJ sets over the internet to each other. A few days later we
				had a domain name, a basic website and a dedicated radio
				chat. We started streaming playlists too, some
				of them live collaborative ones. The music policy was simple:
				there was no policy. Anyone who wanted to contribute was
				welcome to. In the beginning we filled each others homes with
				music and banter seven days a week.
			</p>

			<h2>How it developed</h2>
			<p>
				As time went by and the lockdowns came and went, we settled
				down into a more weekend-focused schedule. We branched out
				into quizzes, comedy hour, community hour talk radio, serious
				listening and more. We kept pumping out playlists and DJ sets
				- over 300 in total (end of 2020). We're especially proud to have nurtured
				new DJ talent, and are hugely grateful to our "old" DJ friends
				for delivering flawless and innovative sets time after time.
				Check them out if you haven't already - virtually all of our
				DJ sets are available on <a class="altlink"
					href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Glastonauts_Live/">Mixcloud</a>,
				while our playlist links can be found in the <a class="altlink" href="archive.html">archive</a>.
				We're also very proud to have at least four talented producers in our collective: <a class="altlink"
					href="https://soundcloud.com/mrlostlegend">LostLegend</a>, <a class="altlink"
					href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Glastonauts_Live/droppenkiken-aka-dj-sebster-unreleased/">Droppenkiken
					aka DJ Sebster</a>, <a class="altlink" href="https://soundcloud.com/sirstylesmusic">Sir Styles
					&#128526;</a> and <a class="altlink" href="https://www.mixcloud.com/andydavies16718/">Andy
					Davies</a>.
			</p>

			<h2>Where we are going</h2>
			<p>
				For "reasons", we need to keep the community small and personal,
				so the radio chat and playlist submission remain
				invite-only. However, everyone is welcome to join the <a class="altlink"
					href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Glastonauts_Live/">Mixcloud</a> community,
				so give us a follow on there, and keep an eye on the <a class="altlink" href="./">schedule</a> if
				you want to catch a set live before it hits the cloud.
